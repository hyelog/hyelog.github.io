- Lukewarm
    - 온도나 반응, 감정 등을 나타낼 때 사용되는 단어로, 두 가지 주요 의미가 있습니다
    - 1. 온도에 관한 의미- Lukewarm은 물이나 다른 액체가 약간 따뜻하거나 미지근한 상태를 나타냅니다. 즉, 그것이 뜨겁지도 않고 차갑지도 않은 중간 정도의 온도를 의미합니다.
    - 2. 감정이나 반응에 관한 의미- 더 비유적인 용법으로, lukewarm은 열정이나 흥미가 별로 없음을 나타냅니다. 예를 들어, 어떤 아이디어나 제안에 대한 "lukewarm response"는 그다지 열정적이거나 흥미롭지 않은 반응을 의미합니다.

    - 예를 들어, 상품 판매를 촉진하기 위해 사용하는 독특한 포장이나 홍보 이벤트는 'gimmick'으로 묘사될 수 있습니다. 그러나 이 단어는 때때로 소비자를 현혹하기 위한 표면적이고 장기적인 가치가 없는 전략을 의미할 때 사용되기도 합니다.
    - "Gimmick"의 정확한 뜻은 사용되는 맥락에 따라 달라질 수 있으며, 대체로 관심을 끌기 위한 독특한 수단이나 방법을 가리키지만 때로는 부정적인 의미로 사용될 수도 있습니다.
